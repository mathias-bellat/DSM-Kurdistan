<p>This document presents the results of the sampling design for the 2022 and 2023 summer field campaigns of the B07 subproject in <em>CRC1070</em>. We used a specific sampling technique called conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). This sampling strategy based on combinations of different <em>strata</em>/layers gave a diversity of samplings according to the heterogeneity of the layers. We tried different numbers of sampling locations (100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400) to finally agree on a set of 100 samplings (We majored the number of samples by 10% - to reach 110 locations - to avoid any issue on the file in case of non-accessible area). The study area covers over 830 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> in 2022 and 490 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> in 2023. The size of area C explored in 2023 is equal to 1450 km<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Still, due to inaccessible places in high mountains or conflict zones between PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) and the Turkish army <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ertan_turkey_2022">Ertan 2022</a>)</span>, we reduce the explored area.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Procedure<a href="CLHS.html#procedure-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>We first produced several maps composed of different factors before using them as layers for the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling. We used different software such as <em>GIS 3.24.1</em> version and <em>SAGA GIS 7.8.2</em>, <em>GoogleEarthEngine</em> (GEE) and <em>R 4.4</em> with <em>Rstudio</em>. The procedure is partially based on the Sampling package from Dick Brus and its reference book <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-brus_spatial_2022">Brus 2022</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The Landsat 8 images were collected <em>via</em> a Google Earth Engine script on a period covering 2020, the median of the composite image from <em>Tier 1 TOA</em> collection was used.

<p>Some sampling locations were located in inaccessible areas so not all the spots have been sampled. Only <strong>101</strong> in 2022 and <strong>21</strong> in 2023.
Despite this lack of few samples sites, the distribution of the cLHS variables was similar to better than a classical random sampling method.</p>
